# model-concept
A Flask 'model-concept' application created to experiment with web-based approaches to health economic modeling. 
# synopsis
The code in this repository creates a simple Markov model using the Flask web framework. Markov models are used to represent stochastic processes and are frequently used in health economic evaluations, usually to model chronic diseases. In a Markov model, the disease under study is divided into distinct states with transition probabilities used to describe the likelihood of moving from one state to the next over a fixed period of time (usually 6-month or 1-year periods). Long term outcomes and costs associated with a disease can then be estimated by attaching unit costs and health effects to states in the model and running the model over a large number of cycles.
